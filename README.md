# Rails-Camp-26
15th-18th November 2019 in Kyneton (north of Melbourne, Victoria)

## Unconference
We are running an unconference at Rails Camp 26. 

If you have a talk or workshop you want to run, open an issue on this repo.

There are no rules on what you can present or for how long, but consider keeping talks under 40 minutes 
and workshops/group activities under 3 hours.

As for content, we are planning to have a room set up for talks with basic audio visual, but perhaps
you have something else in mind and need an outdoor space? Talk to us and we'll see what we can come up with.

Have an idea for something that doesn't involve Ruby or Rails (or computers at all?), jump in!

## Getting there
### Bus
We will run a bus from Melbourne CBD on Friday 15th November at 2.30pm with a stop at Melbourne Tullamarine 
Airport (approx 3pm) and a shopping centre (so you can buy snacks or alcohol if desired). 

If you are flying to Melbourne and want to catch the bus, we recommend arranging a flight that arrives no later than 2pm.

On Monday 18th November, the bus will leave camp at 10am, stop at Melbourne Tullamarine Airport by 11.30am and 
arrive in Melbourne CBD around midday. 

If you are flying from Melbourne and want to catch the bus, we recommend choosing a flight that leaves no earlier than 1pm.

### Car
There is space for parking, if you are planning to drive to camp, let us know and we'll arrange a spot for you

### Public Transport
Vline run several services a day that stop in Kyneton. The campsite is about 10 minutes drive from the station.

## Venue
We will be staying at the beautiful [Campaspe Downs Camp](http://www.pgladventurecamps.com.au/campaspe/), ten minutes drive from Kyneton.

## Food
We have some plans for some excellent food options from local providers!
